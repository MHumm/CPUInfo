# CPUInfo
Old CPUID implementation.
This file stems from DEC V5.2 and should compile with D7.
It has not been tested by me in any way but if somebody finds
it usefull as a starting point for implementing CPU detection
feel free to use it.

Only two things about the licensing:
1. do not claim you have written it, you may only claim you enhanced 
   it if you added code

2. do not remove any copyright comments!
